# Assignment 3, Research on Sustainable Packaging Materials
- Find out list of packaging material that are sustainable (About 4-5 items).
- Areas of exploration (**AOE**)
    - Material properties (heat sealing ability, bendability, transparency, gsm/board thickness)
    - Life cycle assessment (**LCA**)
    - Source/origin of material
    - Market availability and geographic accessibility
 
- Application: Based on the reseach, make a package for real or hypothetical product

# Brainstorm
## Introduction
- What is a sustainable packaging material?
- How it can affect the day-to-day life?
- Some examples??

# Criteria
- Not sure of any yet.

## List of suatainable material
- List some materials, with minor details related to **AOE**.
- Then select one material for the assignment

## Material Properties
Properties to look for are dependent on what kind of producted is used and what's its purpose. However, some of the properties to look for:
  - Thermal strength
  - Inertness
  - Transparency
  - Sustainability (IMP)
  - Many more

## Life cycle assessment
A study that quantifies the footprint of the environmental impact of product from its raw stage to manufacturing, destribution, usage and desposal.

## Source/origin of material

## Market availability and geographic accessibility


# Introduction
- Sustainable packaging is use of non-toxic, recyclable/composite materials with minimum use of energy to create different levels of packaging for a product [2].
- With increasing awareness of consumers on saving the environment and preffering eco-friendly products, by providing a sustainable packaging can bring profits to the company as well [11].
- Use of plastic as packaging material contributes to half of plastic waste globally [12], this can be reduced by promoting and increasing research in sustainable packging.

# List of Materials
1. Bamboo
2. Mycelium
3. Corn Starch packaging
4. Wool
5. ~~Wood Plastic composite~~ Majorly this is a bulding material, but its beens used as packaging material as well.
6. I think its enough

# Properties of Bamboo
- **Abundance**: Bamboo forests are not only growing at 3% per year, but they also cover 32 million hectares of land. Moreover, Bamboo's growth rate is about 1 meter per day making it fastest growing tree [13].
- **Durability**: Among natural reinforcements fibres like flax, cotton, and sisal, bamboo possesses some of the highest mechanical strength and modulus [13].
- **Cost-Effectiveness and Scalability**: High yields and low production costs make it a more commercially viable alternative to other plant-based fibers for mass packaging [13].
- **Thermal and corrosion resistance**: Bamboo composites have better thermal resistance capacity compared to carbon composites and almost same corrosion resistance as that of carbon and glass composites [13].
- **Light weight, and High strength and elasticity**: With density of 0.6-1.1 $g/cm^3$, tensile strenght of upto 800 $MPa$ and Elastic Modulus upto 40 GPa, Bamboo can be reformed into many different desired shapes, and even transformed into paper easily and effectively [09][10][13].
- **Biodegradebility**: Under ideal conditions, bamboo can degrade within 70 days [14], where as some bamboo composites can take upto 6 most as well [15].
